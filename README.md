# Kinetic Keys Project Info
Kinetic Keys SDK v2.2.0 is a comprehensive cryptographic library that combines a lightweight zero-knowledge framework with cutting-edge post-quantum cryptography capabilities. The SDK provides both traditional secure digital transaction features and quantum-resistant security through NIST-standardized algorithms.

### Key Features:
- üÜî Secure ID Generation - Cryptographically secure unique identifiers
- üîë Advanced Key Derivation - Poem-matrix-based hierarchical key systems
- üì¶ Encrypted Vouchers - Secure payload encapsulation
- üß¨ Zero-Knowledge Framework - Privacy-preserving transactions
- üîê Post-Quantum Cryptography - Kyber-1024 & Dilithium-5 (NIST Level 5)
- ‚ö° High Performance - Optimized WebAssembly implementations


- During the PL Genesis Hackathon I integrated Post Quantum Cryptography into Kinetic Keys with NIST Level 5 Kyber 1024 and Dilithium 5 Algorithms via WASM for Quantum Ready Cryptography and reached 585+ weekly downloads.

- I updated the backend code to use the NPM package

- I integrated Filecoin via FilCDN for secure key storage on chain

# Kinetic Keys Project Info

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
